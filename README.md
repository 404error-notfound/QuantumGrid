## 🌍 Scenario

Kenya suffers from **frequent power outages**, **delayed token deliveries**, and **poor customer service** from traditional electricity providers which significantly impacts our day-to-day kuces. (eg Students being forced to miss virtual classes). Furthermore, some people have little to completely no access to electricity due to the high costs and poor service. 

Furthermore, some people have little to completely no access to electricity due to the high costs and poor service. Quantum Grid is a cutting-edge electrical company founded to fix these issues. We provide quick, reliable, affordable and transparent electricity services using contemporary technology. Our goal is to satisfy the needs of the average Kenyan who needs **reliable and affordable** access to power.

Through our platform, tokens can be provided in less than 30 seconds allowing you to keep track of how much electricity you have used and how it corresponds to how much you will be charged. We also aim to provide great customer service which extends to rural communities that are often left out.

We are dedicated to being transparent with our users by communicating with clarity and forewarning any issues which may occur with our system and where they may occur, thereby allowing you to plan around them and ensuring nobody is ever left in the dark.

With Quantum Grid, events such as studying by a candlelight or missing a virtual class due to absence of electricity, will be a thing of the past. We believe that electricity should never be a struggle for any of our fellow Kenyans.
